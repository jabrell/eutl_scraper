				MANUFACTURING 
			</td>
		

			<td valign="top">
				This section includes the physical or chemical transformation of materials, substances, or components into new products, although this cannot be used as the single universal criterion for defining manufacturing (see remark on processing of waste below). The materials, substances, or components transformed are raw materials that are products of agriculture, forestry, fishing, mining or quarrying as well as products of other manufacturing activities. Substantial alteration, renovation or reconstruction of goods is generally considered to be manufacturing.<br><br>The output of a manufacturing process may be finished in the sense that it is ready for utilisation or consumption, or it may be semi-finished in the sense that it is to become an input for further manufacturing. For example, the output of alumina refining is the input used in the primary production of aluminium; primary aluminium is the input to aluminium wire drawing; and aluminium wire is the input for the manufacture of fabricated wire products.<br><br>Manufacture of specialised components and parts of, and accessories and attachments to, machinery and equipment is, as a general rule, classified in the same class as the manufacture of the machinery and equipment for which the parts and accessories are intended. Manufacture of unspecialised components and parts of machinery and equipment, e.g. engines, pistons, electric motors, electrical assemblies, valves, gears, roller bearings, is classified in the appropriate class of manufacturing, without regard to the machinery and equipment in which these items may be included. However, making specialised components and accessories by moulding or extruding plastics materials is included in group 22.2.<br><br>Assembly of the component parts of manufactured products is considered manufacturing. This includes the assembly of manufactured products from either self-produced or purchased components. <br><br>The recovery of waste, i.e. the processing of waste into secondary raw materials is classified in group 38.3 (Materials recovery). While this may involve physical or chemical transformations, this is not considered to be a part of manufacturing. The primary purpose of these activities is considered to be the treatment or processing of waste and they are therefore classified in Section E (Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities). However, the manufacture of new final products (as opposed to secondary raw materials) is classified in manufacturing, even if these processes use waste as an input. For example, the production of silver from film waste is considered to be a manufacturing process.<br><br>Specialised maintenance and repair of industrial, commercial and similar machinery and equipment is, in general, classified in division 33 (Repair, maintenance and installation of machinery and equipment). However, the repair of computers and personal and household goods is classified in division 95 (Repair of computers and personal and household goods), while the repair of motor vehicles is classified in division 45 (Wholesale and retail trade and repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles). <br><br>The installation of machinery and equipment, when carried out as a specialised activity, is classified in 33.20. <br><br>Remark: The boundaries of manufacturing and the other sectors of the classification system can be somewhat blurry. As a general rule, the activities in the manufacturing section involve the transformation of materials into new products. Their output is a new product. However, the definition of what constitutes a new product can be somewhat subjective. As clarification, the following activities are considered manufacturing in NACE:<br>- fresh fish processing (oyster shucking, fish filleting), not done on a fishing boat (see 10.20)<br>- milk pasteurising and bottling (see 10.51)<br>- leather converting (see 15.11)<br>- wood preserving (see 16.10)<br>- printing and related activities (see 18.1)<br>- tyre retreading (see 22.11)<br>- ready-mixed concrete production (see 23.63)<br>- electroplating, plating, and metal heat treating (see 25.61)<br>- rebuilding or remanufacture of machinery (e.g. automobile engines, see 29.10)<br><br>Conversely, there are activities that, although sometimes involving transformation processes, are classified in other sections of NACE; in other words, they are not classified as manufacturing. They include:<br>- logging, classified in section A (Agriculture, forestry and fishing);<br>- beneficiating of agricultural products, classified in section A (Agriculture, forestry and fishing); <br>- preparation of food for immediate consumption on the premises is classified to division 56 (Food and beverage service activities);<br>- beneficiating of ores and other minerals, classified in section B (Mining and quarrying); <br>- construction of structures and fabricating operations performed at the site of construction, classified in section F (Construction);<br>- activities of breaking bulk and redistribution in smaller lots, including packaging, repackaging, or bottling products, such as liquors or chemicals; sorting of scrap; mixing paints to customer order; and cutting metals to customer order; treatment not resulting into a different good is classified to section G (Wholesale and retail trade; repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles).

				This division includes the processing of the products of agriculture, forestry and fishing into food for humans or animals, and includes the production of various intermediate products that are not directly food products. The activity often generates associated products of greater or lesser value (for example, hides from slaughtering, or oilcake from oil production).<br><br>This division is organised by activities dealing with different kinds of products: meat, fish, fruit and vegetables, fats and oils, milk products, grain mill products, animal feeds and other food products. Production can be carried out for own account, as well as for third parties, as in custom slaughtering.<br><br>Some activities are considered manufacturing (for example, those performed in bakeries, pastry shops, and prepared meat shops etc. which sell their own production) even though there is retail sale of the products in the producers' own shop. However, where the processing is minimal and does not lead to a real transformation, the unit is classified to wholesale and retail trade (section G).<br><br>Preparation of food for immediate consumption on the premises is classified to division 56 (Food and beverage service activities).<br><br>Production of animal feeds from slaughter waste or by-products is classified in 10.9, while processing food and beverage waste into secondary raw material is classified to 38.3, and disposal of food and beverage waste in 38.21.

The manufacture of paper involves releasing pulp onto a moving wire mesh so as to form a continuous sheet. Converted paper products are made from paper and other materials by various techniques. <br><br>The paper articles may be printed (e.g. wallpaper, gift wrap etc.), as long as the printing of information is not the main purpose.<br><br>The production of pulp, paper and paperboard in bulk is included in group 17.1, while the remaining classes include the production of further-processed paper and paper products.

			<td valign="top">
				This division includes the manufacture of furniture and related products of any material except stone, concrete and ceramic. The processes used in the manufacture of furniture are standard methods of forming materials and assembling components, including cutting, moulding and laminating. The design of the article, for both aesthetic and functional qualities, is an important aspect of the production process.<br><br>Some of the processes used in furniture manufacturing are similar to processes that are used in other segments of manufacturing. For example, cutting and assembly occurs in the production of wood trusses that are classified in division 16 (Manufacture of wood and wood products). However, the multiple processes distinguish wood furniture manufacturing from wood product manufacturing. Similarly, metal furniture manufacturing uses techniques that are also employed in the manufacture of roll-formed products classified in division 25 (Manufacture of fabricated metal products). The moulding process for plastics furniture is similar to the moulding of other plastics products. However, the manufacture of plastics furniture tends to be a specialised activity.

				This division includes specialised construction activities (special trades), i.e. the construction of parts of buildings and civil engineering works or preparation therefore. These activities are usually specialised in one aspect common to different structures, requiring specialised skills or equipment, such as pile-driving, foundation work, carcass work, concrete work, brick laying, stone setting, scaffolding, roof covering, etc. The erection of steel structures is included, provided that the parts are not produced by the same unit. Specialised construction activities are mostly carried out under subcontract, but especially in repair construction it is done directly for the owner of the property.<br><br>Included is the installation of all kind of utilities that make the construction function as such. These activities are usually performed at the site of the construction, although parts of the job may be carried out in a special shop. Included are activities such as plumbing, installation of heating and air-conditioning systems, antennas, alarm systems and other electrical work, sprinkler systems, elevators and escalators, etc. Also included are insulation work (water, heat, sound), sheet metal work, commercial refrigerating work, the installation of illumination and signalling systems for roads, railways, airports, harbours, etc. Also repair of the same type as the above mentioned activities is included. <br><br>Building completion activities encompass activities that contribute to the completion or finishing of a construction such as glazing, plastering, painting, floor and wall tiling or covering with other materials like parquet, carpets, wallpaper, etc., floor sanding, finish carpentry, acoustical work, cleaning of the exterior, etc. Also repair of the same type as the above mentioned activities is included.<br><br>The rental of equipment with operator is classified with the associated construction activity.

For example, administration of the school system (i.e. regulations, checks, curricula) falls under this section, but teaching itself does not (see section P), and a prison or military hospital is classified to health (see section Q).
